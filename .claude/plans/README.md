# Plans & Strategy

This folder contains strategic plans and design documents for major features and system improvements.

## Purpose

Unlike the `.agent` folder which contains technical documentation and implementation details, this folder focuses on:

- **Strategic vision** and high-level feature concepts
- **User experience design** and product decisions
- **Implementation roadmaps** with timelines
- **Impact analysis** and success metrics

## Document Structure

Each plan document follows this structure:

```
# Plan Title
- **Created:** Date
- **Status:** Proposed/In Progress/Completed
- **Priority:** High/Medium/Low

## Context/Problem Statement
## Solution/Strategy
## Implementation Plan
## Technical Requirements
## Timeline
## Success Metrics
```

## Available Plans

**Focus:** Transform the current KPI/ranking system from corporate performance tracking into an engaging LitRPG-style character progression system.

**Key Components:**
- Character stats framework (Strength, Intelligence, etc.)
- Training quests instead of KPI tracking
- Visual progression feedback
- Achievement and milestone systems

## Plan Status Workflow

- **Proposed:** Initial concept and research phase
- **Approved:** Stakeholder approval, ready for implementation
- **In Progress:** Actively being developed
- **On Hold:** Temporarily paused
- **Completed:** Fully implemented and deployed
- **Cancelled:** No longer being pursued

## Access and Permissions

Plan documents are read-only for most team members. To suggest changes:

1. Create a discussion thread for the specific plan
2. Submit feedback through the designated review process
3. Wait for plan updates during the next review cycle
